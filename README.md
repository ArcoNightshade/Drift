Hollow Orbit: A Melancholic Sci-Fi Survival Game

    You are holding a dying orbit together, knowing it won’t last forever.

Hollow Orbit is a quiet, atmospheric survival game about isolation, maintenance, and the inescapable truth of decay. You play as a lone traveler in the cold vacuum, tending to the fragile remains of a collapsed orbital system. Gravity and time are your constant enemies.

Core Concept

The game embraces a melancholic sci-fi tone, focusing on heavy atmosphere and minimal dialogue. Every action—from patching a hull to launching a probe—is deliberate, reflecting the high stakes of maintaining life in a dying machine.

The Gameplay Loop

    Maintenance: Move between derelict satellites and small habitats to gather power, repair critical systems, and stabilize trajectory using finite fuel and parts.

    Decay: The longer you stay in an orbit, the more severely it decays. Stations drift, resources deplete, and communication links weaken.

    Collapse & Transfer: When an orbit becomes completely unstable or runs out of critical resources, you must execute a desperate maneuver to launch to a new, worse orbit. This cycle repeats until all hope is exhausted.

    Goal: Survive as long as possible, keeping the last remnants of human habitation functional against the inevitable pull of gravity and entropy.

Key Features

    Quiet Tension: Gameplay focuses on systems management and spacewalk navigation, emphasizing the vast emptiness and quiet dread of space.

    Resource Scarcity: Every decision about using power or stabilizing an orbit has long-term consequences.

    Procedural Decay: Each orbital habitat presents unique challenges based on its degradation state, forcing adaptive and difficult choices.

Development Roadmap

This project is currently in the early prototype phase, focusing on establishing the core physics and the survival loop.

1. Engine and Tech Stack

Area	Technology	Rationale
Language	Rust	Used for high performance, memory safety, and robust system architecture.
Engine	Bevy	A modern, high-performance Data-Oriented ECS engine well-suited for simulation logic.

2. Milestone Goals (High Level)

    Phase I (Prototype): Establish basic orbital mechanics (decay calculation, movement), core resource gathering, and simple habitat interaction.

    Phase II (Vertical Slice): Implement one fully functional habitat, the launch/transfer mechanic, and environmental sound/visual assets to lock down the core atmosphere.

    Phase III (Early Access): Full set of decay factors, expanded habitat modules, and the first complete sequence of orbit-to-orbit transfers.
